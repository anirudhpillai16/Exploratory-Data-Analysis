# A linear smoother means that the vector y-hat of predicted values at the
# observed predictor values is a linear function of the data vector y.
# 1. Kernel Smoother
# 2. Lowess Smoother
# Problems with Linear Smoothers
# 1) Strongly affected by outliers
# 2) Smooth over sharp features
# Advantage of Linear Smoother
# reduces high frequency noise and allows closer examination of underlying
# trends
# Disadvantage of Linear Smoother
# Strongly affected by outliers
